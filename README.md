# StuRa Harz University Christmas 2020 Web Shop

A web shop that allowed students at the Harz University of Applied Sciences to buy the official university hoodies for Christmas despite COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. The frontend was developed with Vue.js and Bootstrap and was deployed with GitHub Pages which allowed for 1000+ concurrent users without downtime. The backend was a simple RESTful ASP.Net Core WebAPI deployed with Azure App Service which allowed simple, fast, and secure deployment.
